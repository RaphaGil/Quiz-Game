# Quiz-Game#

## Overview
 This project represents the 6th challenge within my Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp, where I've delved into JavaScript fundamentals. This challenge has been instrumental in reinforcing my understanding of essential concepts, encompassing objects, object methods, nested data, nested looping, functions, parameters, scope, localStorage, JSON, DOM manipulation, and implementing timers.

## Description
This challenge involves designing a quiz with a timer to test users' knowledge. It incorporates features to notify users of incorrect selections by displaying a message and deducting 10 seconds from the total time. Similarly, upon selecting the correct answer, a message appears to acknowledge the correct choice. Additionally, the quiz includes an alert when the time limit is reached, indicating the completion of the quiz. To enhance the user experience, sound effects are integrated for both correct and incorrect selections.
The quiz comprises five questions centered around general knowledge. Upon completion, the user is presented with their final score. They are also provided with the option to save their initials along with their score for future reference.
